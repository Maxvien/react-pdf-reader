## Demo
You can take a look at the demo here: https://reader-zone-test.netlify.com

Although I don't have designs for mobile screens, I'm still improving the test on the [mobile-ui](https://github.com/Maxvien/reader-zone/tree/mobile-ui/src) branch. You can take a look at it here: https://deploy-preview-1--reader-zone-test.netlify.com

**@SarjuHansaliya**: If you have time, please have a look at this project (https://github.com/Maxvien/next-shopify-storefront). So you can see how I worked with TypeScript, NextJS, React, Redux, Apollo Client, Shopify Storefront GraphQL API, ... and Material UI. Thank you! ðŸ˜ƒ
